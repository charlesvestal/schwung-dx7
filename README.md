# Dexed Module for Schwung

Dexed FM synthesizer module for Ableton Move, using the MSFA engine from Dexed.

## Features

- Full 6-operator FM synthesis
- All 32 classic 6-operator FM algorithms
- Loads standard .syx patch banks (32 voices per bank)
- 16-voice polyphony with voice stealing
- Velocity sensitivity and aftertouch modulation
- Pitch bend, mod wheel, sustain pedal support
- Octave transpose (-4 to +4)
- Signal Chain compatible

## Prerequisites

- [Schwung](https://github.com/charlesvestal/schwung) installed on your Ableton Move
- SSH access enabled: http://move.local/development/ssh

## Installation

### Via Module Store (Recommended)

1. Launch Schwung on your Move
2. Select **Module Store** from the main menu
3. Navigate to **Sound Generators** → **Dexed**
4. Select **Install**

### Manual Installation

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Loading Patches

Dexed scans the `banks/` folder in its module directory for .syx files on startup.

### Quick Setup

1. Download DX7-compatible .syx banks (see "Finding Patches" below)
2. Copy to Move's banks folder:
   ```bash
   scp *.syx ableton@move.local:/data/UserData/schwung/modules/sound_generators/dexed/banks/
   ```
3. Restart Schwung to load the new banks
4. Use "Choose Bank" in the Shadow UI to switch between banks

### Patch File Format

The module expects standard DX7-compatible 32-voice bank sysex files:
- 4104 bytes total (with sysex headers)
- 4096 bytes of patch data (32 patches x 128 bytes)
- Standard VMEM packed format

Single-voice VCED dumps are not supported.

### Legacy Support

If no `banks/` folder exists or is empty, Dexed falls back to loading `patches.syx` from the module directory.

## Controls

### Move Hardware

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Jog wheel** | Navigate presets (1-32) |
| **Left/Right** | Previous/next preset |
| **Up/Down** | Octave transpose |
| **Pads** | Play notes (velocity sensitive, with aftertouch) |

### External MIDI

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Note On/Off | Play notes |
| Velocity | Controls operator output levels |
| Pitch Bend | +/- 2 semitones |
| Mod Wheel (CC 1) | LFO pitch/amplitude modulation |
| Aftertouch | Pitch/amplitude modulation |
| Sustain (CC 64) | Hold notes |

## Parameters

In Shadow UI, parameters are organized into navigable categories:

### Global
- `output_level` (0-100) - Output volume
- `octave_transpose` (-3 to +3) - Octave shift
- `algorithm` (1-32) - FM algorithm (read-only, displays current patch algorithm)
- `feedback` (0-7) - Operator 6 feedback amount

### LFO
- `lfo_speed` (0-99) - LFO rate
- `lfo_delay` (0-99) - LFO delay before onset
- `lfo_pmd` (0-99) - Pitch modulation depth
- `lfo_amd` (0-99) - Amplitude modulation depth
- `lfo_wave` (0-5) - Waveform (sine, tri, saw up, saw down, square, S&H)

### Operators
- `op1_level` through `op6_level` (0-99) - Individual operator output levels

These parameters modify the current patch in real-time. Changes are saved with your Schwung patches.

## Finding Patches

Thousands of free DX7 .syx patches are available online:

- https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/dx7.html
- https://yamahablackboxes.com/collection/yamaha-dx7-dx9-dx7ii-patches/
- https://www.polynominal.com/yamaha-dx7/

Classic banks include:
- ROM1A/ROM1B - Original factory presets
- E! series - Famous aftermarket patches

## Troubleshooting

**No sound:**
- Ensure a .syx file is loaded at `modules/dexed/patches.syx`
- The default "Init" patch is very quiet - try changing presets

**Clipping with chords:**
- Dexed can be loud with multiple voices
- Use in Signal Chain with lower mix settings

**Wrong pitch:**
- Ensure you're using standard DX7-compatible .syx files (not TX81Z or other FM synths)

## Building from Source

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Requires Docker or ARM64 cross-compiler.
